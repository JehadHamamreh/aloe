ALOE++ Open Source Framework for SDR (Software-Defined Radio)

Abstraction Layer and Operating Environment (former PHAL-OE - Platform and Hardware Abstraction Layer Operating Environment) is a lightweight middleware that eases the deployment and portability of waveforms on multiprocessing platforms.

The ALOE project develops an open-source SDR framework with cognitive resource management capabilities. Its mission is creating a modular framework that eases the design and integration of software modules (waveform components) and their deployment on multiprocessor execution environments while enabling waveform portability and distributed real-time execution and synchronization
