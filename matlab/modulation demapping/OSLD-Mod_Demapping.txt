Modulation Demapping
====================
We support various options:

- Hard decision (hard_bpsk, hard_qpsk.m, hard_qam16.m, hard_qam64.m)
- Soft decision
	> LLR (llrexact.m)
	> Approximate LLR (llrapprox.m)

constellation_tables.m: Defines the constellation tables (for soft and hard demapping) and other matrices for soft demapping

softdem.m: 		Testsuite (main)
generate_symbols:	Testsuite, signal generation
ref_demod.m: 		Reference demodulators using available Matlab function (singal processing toolbox)
