/** @defgroup gen_dft gen_dft
 *
 * Computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
 *
 * The number of received samples must be an integer multiple of the dft_size parameter. gen_dft then
 * sequentially computes received_samples/dft_size DFTs, each of dft_size points, and concatenates the outputs.
 *
 * The module uses the fftw3 library for computing the dft efficiently. In order to improve the 
 * performance and enable real-time reconfiguration, it precomputes dft plans
 * during the initialization phase for the dft_sizes configured in file dft.h.
 * If the dft_size parameter does not match any of the preconfigured sizes, a new plan is
 * created at runtime. The runtime overhead of computing a new dft plan may cause real-time failures.
