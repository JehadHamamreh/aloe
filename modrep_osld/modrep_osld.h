 * OSLD project repository of DSP blocks.
 *
 * The primary objective of the OSLD project is promoting open-source SDRs and shared development of software for wireless communications systems. The project will develop a modular LTE library for mobile terminals and base stations as well as improve the accessibility of ALOE for building sophisticated radio systems at low cost. Both, ALOE and the open-source LTE library, will leverage open-source R&D, complement university labs, facilitate and encourage shared development, and be a solid basis for innovation and commercialization.
