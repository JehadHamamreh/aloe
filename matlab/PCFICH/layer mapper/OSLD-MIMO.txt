LTE MIMO styles
===============
Single antenna port
Transmit Diversity
Spatial Multiplexing


DL Layer Mapping/Demapping
==========================
lte_PDSCH_layer_mapper.m
lte_PDSCH_layer_demapper.m

All 3 MIMO modes supported with all combinations of codewords q and layers v (all 13 modes supported)


DL Precoding/Un-Precoding
=========================
lte_PDSCH_precoding.m
lte_PDSCH_unprecoding.m

All 3 MIMO modes supported with all combinations of codewords q and layers v, but
Spatial Multiplexing only the mode that uses 'antenna ports with UE-specific reference signals' currently supported
(13 modes supported)
